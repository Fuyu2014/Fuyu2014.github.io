							<h2><img src="images/Travel/ASUS LOGO.png" width="150px" />Visiting  ASUS - Suzhou</h2>
							December 18, 2014
						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<img src="images/Travel/ASUS.JPG" width="250px" height="100px"/>
							<p>ASUS is the most well known computer company founded in Taiwan. In 2013, ASUS becomes the world's fifth-largest PC vendor, after Lenovo, HP, Dell and Acer. My first laptop is ASUS and I was very excited when I heard that I could visit ASUS and learn from Mr. Victor. <br /><br />
								In the picture is ASUS's General Manager, Mr. Victor Kao<br /><br />
							ASUS was founded in Taiwan in 1989, just 2 years before I was born =) The main products at that time are motherboard, processor and accelerator card. And until today, ASUS is still the main supplier for motherboard. <br /><br />
							This visiting has two sections: speech by the general manager Mr. Victor (as shown on the picture) and visiting testing workshops, which is the real fun part, LOL. <br /><br />

							<img src="images/Travel/Victor.JPG" width="250px" height="100px"/>Mr. Victor is a charming person that is very friendly and likes to telling jokes, cold jokes as well. He's absolutely a fan of ASUS because his eyes are sparkling when he introduced his new phones. There's a phone that could be attached to a tablet and the tablet will instantly play whatever on the phone. That product is cool because now you can watch movies on a bigger screen instantly. However, I personally don't like the idea because I simply don't feel the necessity for such tablet. If I were watching movies on a 4.65'' screen size phone, I don't really want to switch to tablet because it is already good enough for me. In my opinion, one way to make this tablet become something people would desire is to specialize in the tablet. For example, if you made the sound system much much better than my phone's sound system, together with a bigger screen, I would want to use the tablet to watch movies. <br /><br />
							
							<img src="images/Travel/ASUS Wifi Router.jpg" width="250px" height="100px"/>There's another product I find fascinating -- <B>ASUS Pocket Wifi Router</B>. I like this product because it is small yet useful. Imagine you are traveling and at the end of day when you come back to your hotel/motel. You really want to share your experience and photos stored in your phone with your friends. However the hotel has only one Lan cable, there's no wifi at all. What can you do now ? Maybe go to a coffee bar and use the wifi there. Now, this pocket Wifi router will be your life saver. This router will broadcast the wifi signal to everyone in your room, now you can easily use your phone to update your blog, your facebook easily. And don't forget that this Wifi router is only as small as your finger! So convinience isn't it! <br /><br />

							Motherboard is ASUS's money cow, and thanks to ASUS's strong financial base, it also start to produce new innovative products: smart watch, smart phone (Zenfont series grabbed a big market share in Asia countries), tablet, games and so on. It's quite a brave company I would say.
